## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/overview
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I added a basic dialog after a user creates their account to let them know that their information led to a successful account creation. The dialog is simple and to ensure users at least acknowledge it, they have to tap Close to exit out of the basic dialog.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I added a bottom navigation bar that will persist throughout the screen. This is to let users easily access frequently visited pages in a single tap. The navigation bar consists of quick links to the pages home, contact us, FAQs, and legal notice.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
For fields that made sense to have a menu (Country, States, Prefix, and Suffix) I added a little arrow in my sketches to indicate the options were stored in a menu. These fields have options that are so common and pre-defined that it makes sense to take out user error and let them pick from a menu.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
