## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=13U0u0kgZ0dja00ja00az06az06 
Your Rationale: I went with this color specifically because Sony was known for making the Playstations black. Those consoles were mysterious and yet neutral looking. To reflect this the site should also be the same color and also to hype people up into seeing an upcoming product.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52P0u0k++iO++nS++nS++nS++nS
Your Rationale: I went with this color palette because I wanted to convey that nature will reveal itself again after a brutal Chicago winter. To convey that, I based my decisions off the readings which mentioned how blue and green specifically conveyed calm undertones.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=30I0f0k++MMO5++O5++O5++O5++
Your Rationale: I went with this mainly because the readings mentioned how orange was an inviting and friendly color. The last thing kids need is to go onto a scary website to learn the alphabet. To complement the inviting and friendly colors I also had hints of blue sprinkled in to give off the feeling that the site would be a calm one.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=b003x1J0k++kX++xZ++q2++f0++7+
Your Rationale: I went with this color palette because I wanted to convey that cybersecurity will tackle dangerous problems in the real world. Red and yellow seemed like the perfect mix. However, because I know the educators want their cut of the pie, I offset the danger with blue to remind viewers that they are on a professional site that aims to educate those on cybersecurity.
