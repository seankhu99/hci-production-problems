    Strategy 3, embrace the other, was the deciding factor for pairing Merriweather and Lato together.
    Merriweather is a serif typeface and based on what strategy 3 states, it will pair well with a sans serif
    typeface. Interesting enough the core philosophy behind Merriweather's creation is that it would be pleasant to 
    read on screen. Even more interesting is that Merriweather has a sans-serif version appropriately named
    Merriweather Sans. Merriweather is managed by Sorkin Type, a type design foundary based in Western Massachaussets.

    Personally I liked how Merriweather looked. It's a very clean font that is easy on the eyes and envokes business.

  <h1 id="Lato"> Lato</h1>

    As with Merriweather, Strategy 3 was the deciding factor for pairing Lato with Merriweather. Interesting, Lato was created in
    2010 and was created by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic. The name Lato translates to summer in Polish. Fitting to the summer name, Lato was
    designed to have warm and serious feel. Another interesting note of trivia is that Lato was originally intended for a  
    business before they pulled out and went with a different style. Had they not done that, Lato may have never enjoyed a
    public release.

    Personally I liked how Lato looked. Like with Merriweather, it's a clean font that looks serious. However, I get a much less
    formal vibe from it and it doesn't scream at me like its a legal document.
